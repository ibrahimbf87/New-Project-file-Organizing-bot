# New-Project-file-Organizing-bot
Here I tried to create a automated system to keep organized all of our new project files. In our team or whenever I do a project I always try to keep everything organized from the very beginning and to do so this will save me a lot of time. Also creating new file and sub files are also repetative and boring so this becomes handy in these situation.

See the flowCart to understand about the file order. You can use this code if needed and change it accourding too your needs and if you do so giving credit will be highly appreciated.
